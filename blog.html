  <h2>Avialablity regarding different suubject fields</h2>
  <p>I made notes starting from January-2016 on EVERNOTE only from Daily Current Events+Editorials of Insights. I had made 5 Notebooks, 4 for each GS Paper and 1 for editorials. The 4 GS notebooks were divided into notes with headings according to our GS mains syllabus. I would copy paste everythin I wanted from the Daily current events into the respected note.</p>

  <h2>How to study for back-to-back exams?</h2>
  <p>The word “exam” in itself can be really fearful and stressful. Majority of students are always not satisfied with their preparation and have the fear of failure, thus switching to last moment cramming or surfing the internet to find ways to study.

When the students can’t prepare for exams when blessed with multiple days leaves, it’s easy to imagine how they will fare with consecutive exams</p>

  <h2>Service vs product based companies</h2>
  <p>They make software as per the requirement of client.
Dynamic in nature
Need to be a MultiTasker .
Selection procedure: conducts simple interview rounds like 3 to 4 rounds and are mostly based on technology knowledge and coding for which they are hiring
They will not provide justifications for rejection or selection.
Learning: no learning in the projects. It will make you jack of all master of none.
 large team size leading to high politics high work pressure and job uncertainty
Less salary then product based companies
Very inflexible timings, you have to complete the fixed hours (8-9 hrs) in the office before leaving.
TCS, Infosys ,Accenture, Cognizant etc.  Are service based companies
They train the candidates on the technology as per the requirement
They are generally mass recruiters</p>
